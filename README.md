# TableCheck interview task : Weather-app

## Description

## Comments

- normalize.css is used for it's superior browser support (which is needed because we are targeting IE 11). The catch is it's a bit old and janky. i had to write some code in `global-styles.css` regarding `html` and `body` that i probably wouldn't have needed if i used a better CSS reset
